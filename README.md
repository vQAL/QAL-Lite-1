# QAL-Lite
The free public watered-down version of QAL.

QAL (Quantum Algorithms Lab) is an innovative visual interactive web app for teaching and researching quantum algorithms and quantum informatics, as well as related mathematical fields such as linear algebra and group theory.

As to teaching math in particular, QAL aims to teach the concepts of linear algebra (and group theory) visually and interactively as an intuitive game.

QAL Lite presents a glimpse of the main features of QAL.  Check the 'QAL Abstract' and 'QAL Lite Screenshots' files for more details.
