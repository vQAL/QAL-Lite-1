# QAL Lite
**QAL Lite** is the free public cut down version of QAL.

**QAL** (Quantum Algorithms Lab) is an innovative visual interactive web app for *teaching* and *researching* quantum algorithms and quantum informatics, as well as related mathematical fields such as linear algebra and group theory.

As to teaching math in particular, QAL aims to teach the concepts of linear algebra (and group theory) visually and interactively as an intuitive *game*.

Besides quantum computing, the math nicely presented in QAL has applications in machine learning, computer graphics, and cybersecurity, among many other mathematical sciences.

QAL Lite presents a glimpse of the main features of QAL. Check the `QAL-Abstract` and `QALLite-Screenshots` files available here for more details.
